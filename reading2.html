        One quote that stood out to me in this reading was "from someone, for someone,
        in a particular context." This rubric shifted my approach on how to evaluate 
        whether a piece of work was created by a human or AI. The biggest takeaway for 
        me is the importance of expressiveness, emotion resonance, and being able to sense
        that a real human is sharing their own experience and perspective. I think this 
        rubric criteria will become more and more critical to keep in mind, especially
        as AI continues to improve going forward.
