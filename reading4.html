            <b>What did you think about the essay? Did anything in particular resonate?</b><br>
            I really enjoyed reading this essay, and it definitely made me rethink what a website is. I like how open-ended websites are as they can esentially be whatever you want them to be. One idea that resonated with me was the comparison between building a website and creating a world. Individuals aren't only sharing content inside a world, but they are also shaping the environment around it. I also feel like you can learn a lot about someone through the websites they create based on what they choose to show, how they organize it, and what they link to.

            If I had a website, it would be a highway - a continuous path you can travel in different ways depending on the day. Some days you might move quickly and other days you might slow down and get “stuck in traffic.” Sometimes you might even take an exit that leads somewhere unexpected. Like a highway with different lanes, you could move between pages seamlessly, exploring new paths while still staying connected to the main route.

            <b>What can you do with a website that you make yourself that you can't do if someone else makes your website?</b><br>
            When you make your own website, you have full control over the content, structure, and experience. You get to decide what to share, what to emphasize, how the pages connect, and how someone moves through or interacts with the site. You can choose whether to continuously update it or create it once and leave it alone. Most importantly, you have the freedom to integrate your own identity and personality into the site, treating it as a living space that you can revise, experiment with, or abandon whenever you want.
