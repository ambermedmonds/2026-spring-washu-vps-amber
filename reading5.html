    <h1>Documentary "Eno"</h1>
    <p><em>inspired by the subject of the film, artist, and musician Brian Eno</em></p>
    <p> 
        I thought this documentary was very engaging and thought-provoking! Several ideas stood out to me, especially Eno's discussions of music, art, and creativity.

        Music is a huge part of my daily life as I listen to it every day whether I’m driving to campus, doing homework, or playing tennis. There are a lot of reasons why I listen to music: it helps me focus, it energizes me, and sometimes the lyrics capture exactly what I’m feeling in the moment. As I was watching the documentary, I found it super interesting to think about why humans like music on a deeper level. Eno mentions that one of the thrills of music is the sense that you are synchronized with something, and that humans have a strong desire to feel like they belong. This idea resonated with me as I feel like the social aspect of music is a big part of why it's important to us. A lot of my friends and I share songs we love and trade recommendations to expand our music tastes. Additionally, apps like Spotify have made music feel even more social with features like collaborative playlists, Jam sessions, and its annual Spotify Wrapped campaign. With that in mind, it was especially cool to see Eno’s own interpretation of music, and how he experimented with generative pieces that evolve over time, as well as “found” or sampled sounds from all kinds of sources.

        Another theme that stuck with me was art as a form of human connection. Eno suggests that our brains may be “getting smaller” as we've become more specialized and increasingly rely on products and knowledge built by other people. At the same time, we’re also more connected than ever, especially with relatively recent inventions like the Internet. In this modern/digital age, it is more critical to think about how we interact and remain in sync with one another. Eno argues that art is one of the main ways we do that as it helps us communicate and connect at a deeper level of consciousness. I agree that art can be an incredibly powerful form of expression that often evokes feelings that help people feel more understood and connected.

        Eno's perspective on creativity also caught my attention. I loved his metaphor of balancing the playful inner child that likes to have fun with the inner critic that evaluates what’s working. This reframed how I think about the creative process: letting yourself play/experiment, while also knowing when it’s time to take a step back and refine your work. Overall, I really enjoyed this documentary as it made me reflect more deeply on why things like music and art matter, and how they shape the way we understand ourselves and connect with others.
