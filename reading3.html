        I thought it was really interesting to read about the distinction between “cyborgs” and “rooms” as two visions for the future of computing. I feel like I'm much more familar with the “cyborg” path as my family regularly uses AirPods and Apple Watches. This direction feels more natural, especially given how seamlessly wearables integrate into our daily routines and lives.

        However, what stood out to me the most was the author's emphasis on rooms and augmented environments. While I've seen/heard a little bit about smart homes, Dynamicland reframed how I think about physical spaces. The idea of a room as a computer, especially one designed for collaboration and experimentation was eye-opening to read about. The sketches of Dynamicland's communal science lab were super cool to look at and made this vision feel even more concrete and compelling. I'm curious to see how room-scale computing will continue to develop in the future and how it might reshape how we think and interact with each other.
