        I think restaurant websites are a great way for restaurants to express 
        their unique personality and atmosphere, while also serving as a centralized
        hub for finding information. Not only can you get a good sense of what the
        restaurant experience might feel like, but you can also learn more about the 
        restaurant's story, menu items, locations, etc.

        As someone who has used website building tools like SquareSpace and Wix, 
        I thought it was interesting to think about how templates impact creative 
        freedom and output. While you can usually change things like fonts, colors,
        etc., sometimes templates can feel a bit constraining as you can't always
        customize every detail.
