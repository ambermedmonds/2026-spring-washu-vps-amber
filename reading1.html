    <h1>Restaurant Websites</h1>
    <p><em>by Meg Miller and Laurel Schwulst</em></p>

        I think restaurant websites are a great way for restaurants to express 
        their unique personality and atmosphere, while also serving as a centralized
        hub for finding information. Not only can you get a good sense of what the
        restaurant experience might feel like from a well-designed website, but you 
        can also learn more about the restaurant's story, menu items, locations, etc.

        Having used website building tools like SquareSpace and Wix, it's interesting 
        to think about the trade-off between templates and creative freedom. While these
        platforms make it easy to change things like fonts and colors, sometimes templates
        can feel a bit constraining as you can't always customize every single detail.

        I'm curious to see how new technologies like generative AI will impact user's 
        ability to create websites. I feel like it could help make web-design more accessible
        to non-technical users, but I wonder how it will impact creativity and personalization.
