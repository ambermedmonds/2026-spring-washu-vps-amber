        <h2>About</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <p>Nudo House is a fast-casual, pan-Asian eatery focused on great food and warm hospitality. Aromatic pho from decades-long family recipes and ramen uniquely created through the mentorship by one of Japan's foremost ramen chefs are the main attractions. The restaurant also features a variety of dishes with Vietnamese, Japanese, Chinese, and Filipino influences. The menu spans noodles and soups to sandwiches and salads, as well as popular favorites such as spring rolls and crab rangoon. Globally-inspired flavors of soft serve rotate weekly for those with a sweet tooth. Ultimately, Nudo is the celebration of how powerful food can be and fueled by that gratitude and inspiration for its ability to bring people together and make everyone feel at home anywhere, anytime.</p>

            <h3>Qui Tran - Owner</h3>
            <p>Qui Tran and his parents are the “American Dream” of the Vietnam diaspora. Refugees of war, they landed in St. Louis, MO in 1980 when he was just 3 years old. Qui's mother, Lee, opened the first Vietnamese restaurant in the area, Mai Lee. Qui grew up in the family business and has worked his way around the kitchen and front-of-the-house ever since. Tran is a relentless champion for St. Louis and its dining community. He supports many charitable causes and participates in promotional events that helps to bring visibility to the region. Qui is humbled to be an ambassador for his beloved city, its restaurant scene, and its immigrant communities. “The people of St. Louis essentially made Mai Lee the success it is today. What started out as a way to help my parents pay the bills and keep a roof over my head has now provided me with a platform to advocate for my city and the amazing people in it. Food is at the heart of my story. It is my belief that American food is immigrant food and I want to explore and share those stories to whomever is willing to listen.”</p>
